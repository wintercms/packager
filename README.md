# Packager

Run Composer commands and execute Composer searches and queries within a PHP application. This library acts as a PHP wrapper for Composer commands, allowing package management through PHP, and uses a combination of Composer, the Packagist API and your own project lockfile to derive information about the packages installed or available.

You technically *do not* need Composer to be installed, as this library will bring in the Composer application as a dependency - however, you will need Composer to install this library itself.

## Use case

This library was written initially to provide Composer usage through PHP for [Winter CMS](https://github.com/wintercms/winter), to power
its upgrade and plugin architecture. A portion of the Winter CMS user-base prefer web-based installation methods and prefer not to (or simply can't) use the command-line Composer application.

This library therefore leverages the power of Composer in maintaining dependencies and does so in a way that can be programatically controlled and presented in a friendlier format for these users.

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```
composer require winter/packager
```

## Usage

This library currently provides support for the following Composer commands:

- `install`
- `search`
- `show`
- `update`
- `require`
- `remove`
- `version` **(--version)**

You can create a `Composer` instance in your PHP script and run these commands like so, defining a working directory which contains a `composer.json` file, and a home directory in which cached packages are stored.

```php
<?php
use Winter\Packager\Composer;

$composer = new Composer();
$composer
    ->setWorkDir('/home/me/project/')
    ->setHomeDir('/tmp/composer');

// Get the Composer version
$version = $composer->version();

// Run an install or update on the entire project, including dev dependencies
$install = $composer->install();
$update = $composer->update();

// Install project without dev dependencies
$install = $composer->install(false);

// Show installed packages
$show = $composer->show();

// Search packages
$results =
```

Documentation on each command will be forthcoming soon.

## Limitations

- Composer uses `symfony/process` under the hood for various actions. Most shared hosts will not allow this work, by blocking either the `proc_*` functions or the `pcntl` extension. If this is the case for your host, you will be unable to use scripts or some plugins.

## Security Implications

Note that this library does introduce some security implications which you may need to consider before using.

- If this library is used in a web-based environment, you must make the vendor folder and files writable for the user running your web server. You **should not** make your vendor folder web-accessible, otherwise this will become an easy vector for an attack.
- Allowing scripts to run within Composer may grant the script access to your web environment or outlying PHP application. You should not run scripts unless you absolutely trust your dependencies.
